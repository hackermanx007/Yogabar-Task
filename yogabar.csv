Kavrao,18,January,2019,January 2019,5,Great product! Great price!,A very good product with good taste along with great ingredients! Very aptly priced with great packaging. Best thing to carry to work which helps one avoid junk food when hungry. Excited to try other flavors as well.
Lakshya Kamra,21,January,2019,January 2019,5,Great product,"Overall a great product. The packet inside is resealable which protects it from moisture. Great taste. Although Baggry's is similar, I chose this as it contains chia and flax as well."
Deepesh V,23,January,2019,January 2019,3,Just ok,Okayish taste...
Asif Ahamad,27,January,2019,January 2019,3,No so good,Includes nuts of more quality than dry fruits.. So it is not worth for what we are spending

King,17,February,2019,February 2019,4,A truly homegrown cereal,"I have been a regular consumer of cerals over the past few years and have tasted quite a few. Viz. Dorset, kellogs muesli etc. Yoga is quite a healthy mix of seeds, oats fruits and overall likeable to the Indian palate. Would wish for a higher portion of fruit. Would rate it 4 stars over the other Indian cereals available."
Pramod Raikar,18,February,2019,February 2019,5,good quality ingredients.,"I have tried yogabar cereal bars and they were great, good quality ingredients and not too sweet. I stumbled upon their Muesli and as per Swiss Muesli style. It turned to be great."

PS...,27,February,2019,February 2019,4,Loving it!!,"I have been yogabar breakfast bars fan. So, I thought of giving the muesli a try. I was using kellogs muesli from a long time that tasted great but i was not liking huge corn flakes in it..So, at first the muesli taste was a little weird as i was used to diff muesli.. but second time onwards i liked the taste. It's great quality muesli."
Shobhi,28,February,2019,February 2019,5,Healthy and tasty,"YogaBar offers variety of museli's and must say this flavour is delicious and healthy. The presence of rich nuts and dried fruits along with cranberries, apricots and other ingredients make a perfect super lovely breakfast for me. It makes my stomach full and also make me stay fit. Thanks to yogabar for such amazing healthy food"
mum_n_kiddos,1,March,2019,March 2019,5,Awesome taste and a healthy breakfast option,"Morning breakfast is now easy with this delicious crunchy muesli. Me being a fruits and nuts lover, loved it and it has all berries which gives awesome taste. All healthy ingredients like oats, brown rice flakes, raisins, cranberries, apricots. Black currants ,quinoa, pumpkin, chia and flax seeds, this is a combined mixture of all healthy foods. Just 200 calories and I am sorted in morning. Tastes best with cold milk. Even it makes a great dry snacking option anytime during the day. Perfect when you are on balanced diet and will recommend you all to give it a try."
Kapil Sharma,1,March,2019,March 2019,5,Tasty and healthy snack.,"This is a very good breakfast snack loaded with fruits, nuts, seeds and muesli which gives you long lasting energy for 4-5 hours continuously. it helps you to stay fit and lean without skipping any meal.

Some of good things about it:

1. It contains complex carbohydrates from quinoaz oats and brown rice. Hence, it will not increase your blood sugar level.

2. It is very delicious and tasty. I bought strawberry flavour and I feel like eating ice cream.

3. Flex and chia seeds contained in it gives you a good dose of fiber so you won't get problems like constipation.

4. It is very high in protein so if if you're someone who wanted to build muscle mass then use this."
Saurabh,1,March,2019,March 2019,5,Best cereal for my diet,"I've tried all the flavors of Yogabar and this one is my favorite one.

ankita r.,11,March,2019,March 2019,4,Worth buying,Yogabar stood out in terms of taste and ingredients when compared with other popular breakfast mueslis like Kellogg's. It comes with various beneficial seeds and dried fruits and is not excessively sweet which usually is usually the case. Would definitely repurchase this but it just takes a lot of time to arrive.
Shanu Maurya,12,March,2019,March 2019,4,Good taste!,I like this product.
Rashmi Udani,14,March,2019,March 2019,5,Must for healthy eating habit,"This is for someone who would like to go on a strict diet. The taste of fruits and nuts especially cranberry will be something that you will crave for. You can add it to Milk, curd, orange juice or simply have it as it is. Yogabar has now become a known brand for Museli and bars. The Museli is really very tasty and crunchy, full of nutritious value and lots of fibre."
DSood,14,March,2019,March 2019,5,Welcome change from the standard breakfast cereals,"A welcome change from the standard breakfast cereals, great nutritional value and taste.

Soma,6,April,2019,April 2019,4,Just ok,"It is crunchy n good,I like the little pumpkin seeds which r un4tunately less in it..I gave 3stars (see update) coz it's very sweet 4me,I dnt eat that much sweet,so I was drinking cold milk with it (without pouring the milk in it,otherwise it wud have lost its crunch)..the milk seem 2help cut down all the sweetness..but the sweetness is not from sugar,it comes from Jaggery that has been added 2it..I dnt love the taste very much,but I dnt dislike it either..if this helps me loose weight a little bit,why not eat it :-)
I also got the dark chocolate one,will try it after finishing this1 :-)
Try it out :-)
Update-after 3-4days of eating this,I started 2like it very much (giving 4stars now)..if I loose weight, I'll give 5stars :-D"

Viney Sagar,19,May,2019,May 2019,2,Bad experiance,Very less protien. 50 gm = 6 gm protien.. Bulshit. Atleast 20 gm protien should be there... Protien is most important nutrient.
Krishna,21,May,2019,May 2019,4,"Good quality, excellent packaging",Bought this as it is one of the very few muesli with seeds. I'd have preferred a more crunchy texture but it isn't so bad. Ingredients used seem to be of good quality especially the raisins but are a bit too large for my liking. The packaging is really good. The muesli is in a resealable pouch with one transparent side which helps check the level of cereal remaining
aravind p nair,22,May,2019,May 2019,5,"Healthy, delicious and worth the money","Tastes good and healthy too.. a good replacement for breakfast esp. If work timings are tight for cooking a elaborate breakfast... i have it with honey, milk and dates syrup... love the combo"
Mithun,23,May,2019,May 2019,3,Cream biscuit/waffers taste..not good,Taste is like strawberry cream biscuit/waffers..not for those who are planning to reduce weight..Please choose kellog's Muesli fruit instead..it has better taste..if you are on strict diet then please choose Baggry's muesli which is plain and not sweet at all..Tried Yogabar once and going back to Kellog's..

RS,27,May,2019,May 2019,2,Disappointed,"The Muesli had very little nuts and a lot of seeds. Some of the raisins still had their stems/twigs attached to the fruit, suggesting they were not cleaned before mixing. Didn't enjoy the product as much as I had thought I will. Big disappointment."

Tanya jaiswal,1,July,2019,July 2019,5,Tastier and healthier alternative.,"Ordered this product few days back For a change! But I'm glad to say that i haven't got disappointed at all. As the name suggests it contains good amount of dry fruits,nuts and seeds and is really delicious. It's tastier, healthy and better than the other brands out in the market. It's available at a very pocket friendly price. The best thing is that this one do not contain corn flakes which i do not like at all and wanted a good replacement for that as well. I'd like to recommend this product to everyone."

Amazon Customer,29,August,2019,August 2019,1,Chia and flax seeds burnt... awful and no return,"I am a huge fan of yoga bear whole grain until i have received a package from Amazon, the flax seeds and the chia seeds are burnt, the pumpkin seeds and the oats are roasted more than required, they have become brown, the entire taste of the muesli has changed, the sweetness of the berries has become less, the amount of raisins have gone down, the size of the flat brown rice has become small I seriously don't understand how can a reputed and highly sold muesli not have consistency maintained. Very disappointed, now scared to order online as there is no return."

Amazon Customer,6,September,2019,September 2019,5,Great taste. Value for money.,"This is the best muesli you can find in the market, and believe me, I tried many. Not sticky, very little sweetener in it, no sugar, no gluten... and tastes great.
I don't like though that the product comes inside a big cardboard box. They could sell only with the bag and save lots of trees. It also takes too much space so I always throw the box and keep the muesli in the resealable bag."

This is our second order and we are very satisfied with the product"
amanpreet,21,September,2019,September 2019,2,"Too sweet, that ruins the taste",Bought this product after great reviews. But I did not like it much. It has a weird sweetness that ruins the whole taste. Maybe it's from berries. Rest the ingredients are a good mix. Can try if you don't mind your museli to be sweet.
ALFIN DAVIS,21,September,2019,September 2019,4,Too much smell of strawberry...otherwise okay.,The dried strawberry tasted nasty.Also there was too much strawberry smell in the pack.I think they have added artifical strawberry flavour.

Amazon Customer,22,September,2019,September 2019,5,Yogabar is for all.,Product is awesome tasty and palatable.
Siddharth,24,September,2019,September 2019,1,Cheating customers,"Quality of product has deteriorated badly. The two boxes I purchased got ""burnt grains"". Also some of the seeds float when milk is put, meaning the company is now using expired items. Even the rasins are put like lump of balls...
Only thing that is good is the packing... not the actual product.
Anyway, this company planned that they will initially gain customer confidence, get good rating and later give 3rd class product.
Very disappointing..."
Amazon Customer,24,September,2019,September 2019,5,Yummy 😋,"Product is superb, but price is little high.. Flavor 👍💯"

muskan garg,28,September,2019,September 2019,5,LOVED IT!!!,"This is my first ever trying a healthy product such as muesli and I'm shook!!! The taste is amazing. I love the mixture as it contains a variety of seeds, nuts and dried fruits 😌
I've heard a lot about flax and chia seeds, can definitely see why! I've switched my breakfast with this muesli and this is probably the best decision I've taken for my body in a while. 🙌🏼
I like to have it with honey, fresh berries or bananas and some milk!!! It's quite fulfilling and provides the right amount of energy to Kickstart my day. 🙌🏼😌
Yoga bar muesli has changed the game for me, can't wait to try other flavours!! 😋😋😋"
Wafa,29,September,2019,September 2019,5,Tasty and healthy,"I used to be always in hurry in morning and skip my breakfast. It's healthier than cornflakes, no need of cooking and tastes better than other museli available in market."
Bhavleen s.,30,September,2019,September 2019,3,Boxes were all torn up, The box was all torn up and I'm afraid it would be all mashed up inside ingredients
Avinash,30,September,2019,September 2019,5,Right combination of ingredients and healthy too!,Its a perfect combination for all those who dislike the bland oatmeal diet..
Arihant Pandey,30,September,2019,September 2019,5,Crunchy Munchy and tasty,"Got it a few days back and I was surprised with the taste and texture of the product. It's way better than any other brand. I could literally see the ingredients like strawberry, raisins etc. I could feel the crunchiness of the nuts and other items in the Muesli. Strawberry tastes awesome with milk and drops of honey."

its value for money.... i would recomand to buy without second thought."
Reetu,3,October,2019,October 2019,5,Breakfast sorted,If you like slightly tangy and sweet bits of fruits in your breakfast cereals this one is definitely for you. Though I like the chocolate flavor more than this one but it's actually better in terms of the ingredients and their health benefits. It has pieces of dried fruits making it a healthy breakfast option. I think this would make a delicious topping on yogurt.
Swastika nagpal,3,October,2019,October 2019,5,Must give it a try,"I really want to applaud the ppl at yogabar who come up with such great combinations, the perfect taste, they have mastered the art of what will taste the best with what.

Kindle Customer,11,November,2019,November 2019,5,My favourite muesli! And it's a bargain on Amazon deals!,"I love this product. I found it in a local shop and it rapidly became my favourite muesli, reminding me of my favourite one that I used to get in Lidl (shop in Europe). So I was thrilled when I not only found it on Amazon, but at a cheaper price than the local shop.
The item was delivered on time, as described, and I love it so much, I'm repeatedly keeping it in stock. It's oaty, with great amount of nuts & dried fruit to boot. I use it for daily cereal for breakfast, and my mother in law loves it with warm milk.
Thanks again, Amazon - and Yoga Bar!"

Shiv Shankar Ash,16,February,2020,February 2020,2,Disappointing purchase.,"I'm a big fan of Yogabar range of Mueslis and order them frequently. I decided to buy the 700 gm super saver pack when it was cheaper during the great Indian sale. Got it for Rs 349. However, the pack was full of lumps rather than the usual consistency. It was really annoying as it altered the taste a lot. All the lumps were overtly sweet and rest of the muesli was dry and tasteless. Moreover, they didn't dissolve in milk and by the time it did, the rest of the cereal got soggy. I really hope it was a one time thing and won't happen again in the future. I'm still waiting to hear from Yogabars.
Hope this review is helpful."

But I do not have good experience as regard to quality. It is for sure, not having 22% of fruit and nut. Which was the main reason for me to go for it leaving Baggery. Perhaps Yogabar people are intending to do cost cutting by adding less while promising more. I can not return as per product return policy."

Amazon Customer,28,May,2020,May 2020,4,Nice product and Value for money,Nice taste. The product is having a zip lock which has a tight fit. The fruits quantity should be increased a little more which seems less when compared to museli
Anil Debata,28,May,2020,May 2020,4,Happy,Good product
RJ,29,May,2020,May 2020,4,GOOD MUESLI / LESS DRIED FRUITS.,"Pros: On opening the zip lock package, the aroma was just superb. Quantum of whole grains 50% (rolled oats and brown rice flakes) and seeds 18% (quinoa, pumpkin, chia and flax) seemed right and to my satisfaction.

Cons: Quantum of dried fruits 22% (apricots, black currants, cranberries and raisins) and almonds is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.

Conclusion: Overall, I like this muesli due to the main ingredients of whole grains and seeds and have ordered the seven hundred grams packet. To increase the dried fruit content, I have purchased the two hundred grams packet of 'Nutty Gritties Mix Berries' containing dried black currants, blueberries, strawberries and cranberries to mix with the muesli (I hope Nutty Gritties does not disappoint).

I want to compare the above combination with Bagrry's Fruit 'n' Fibre, Mixed Fruit Muesli (consumed and enjoyed earlier) and decide which to settle for.

Four stars for the main ingredients; one star docked for less dried fruits."

I will be buying it again."
Amazon Customer,8,June,2020,June 2020,5,All's well,"It tastes, smells, and looks great. in fact, it is an amazingly healthy mix.

Deepsikha Sarkar,20,June,2020,June 2020,4,Muesli review,"I like the flavour and it tastes good. Out of various muesli brand that I have tried, I like yogabar muesli the most as it has a mix of nuts and seeds. The seeds and nuts together gives a crunchy experience. I am going to buy it again. What I don't like about it is the carbohydrate content in each serving. It's quite high when compared to protein content and I guess my main purpose for which I switched to muesli (i.e., weight loss) is not gonna be of great help in this regard."

Piyush Mishra,24,August,2020,August 2020,4,Not a healthy food at all. Too much sugar syrup taste that dominates other natural flavours,Just too much sugar to my taste. Its doubtful if its all natural sugar or processed. It is more of a comfort food and less of a healthy food. The food should have been natural and not candied out in syrup. I was not expecting this from a brand that has Yoga in its name. Dissappointed
Kindle Customer,24,August,2020,August 2020,4,Go for it!,The pack is certainly very tasty and wholesome in health

Sukanya Baliarsingh,8,September,2020,September 2020,4,Smells tasyea,"It's been two whole days now and the taste of this cereal is so refreshing that I don't feel the need to munch on anything else throughout the day. Healthy, tasty and definitely smells so good.
Oh and also, I totally forgot to mention, it uses flax seeds, which is quite honestly very rarely available these days but is so good for stomach issues, and the fact that it doesn't have a weird smell for all the mixed nuts is my favorite. Loving it. Gonna try different flavors next month!"
Reshmi De,8,September,2020,September 2020,5,Satisfied with the product,The product is filled with fruits and is a good value for money. If you like it sweeter then you could add some honey to enhance the flavours.
