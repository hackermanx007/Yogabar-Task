So glad to find it on Amazon. Got it very well packed and Muesli was so fresh as well."

AEL,4,October,2018,October 2018,4,Good stuff but there is better and more original Muesli out there ...,"This Kelloggs product, like all Kelloggs products is of good quality but I think that other grains or roughage should be increased and the 'processed' flake content should be reduced.
It is after all being called a Muesli, which in Europe (where the concept originates) never contains processed flakes.

A great product to compare this with is Alpen Muesli (used to be a Weetabix product, I think but is now just ""Alpen"")."

P.Raju,5,March,2019,March 2019,2,"This is not Muesli, rather Cornflakes","This is no way close to anything called as Muesli. In fact, it's a pack of Corn flakes with some fruits and nuts (hardly 1 to 2%). Can't believe a brand like Kellogg's is trying to cheat its customers charging high price by selling corn flakes in the name of Muesli. Not recommended !!
(PS : Having eaten Muesli in Europe for nearly 5 years I know exactly what it should contain)"

Harshad,7,April,2019,April 2019,2,Opened box product with more cornflakes in it,"I ordered this product as part of Amazo Pantry. When received I noticed the box was opened while the inner packet was intact. In general, the Kellog's Muesli comes with combination of nuts, muesli and cornflakes.

To my surprise, once I opened the box, I could see that the content of the packages had only nuts and cornflakes with muesli almost non-existent. Too bad from Kellogg's."

I used to add muesli cold milk and some honey. The honey makes a big difference in taste and enhances the taste.
This also contains everything you need in the morning, also has dried fruits in them, some might love the fruits some might just hate it there is no middle ground.

Juned Saiyad,22,June,2020,June 2020,2,Not buying again,"1. Most corn flakes are not healthy at all. They contain too much carbohydrate. Aprox 60 percent.

2.Package saying 21% fruit and seeds. But its mainly cornflakes and only little fruits and seeds.

Better buy sugar free muesli."
