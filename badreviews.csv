Amazon Customer,"I am a huge fan of yoga bear whole grain until i have received a package from Amazon, the flax seeds and the chia seeds are burnt, the pumpkin seeds and the oats are roasted more than required, they have become brown, the entire taste of the muesli has changed, the sweetness of the berries has become less, the amount of raisins have gone down, the size of the flat brown rice has become small I seriously don't understand how can a reputed and highly sold muesli not have consistency maintained. Very disappointed, now scared to order online as there is no return."
ganesh,The worst dry fruits have gone bad and have lot of bugs or insects i dont know so disappointing.
Suresh P.,My sister bouGht this it doesn't delivered with the box after eating this she got rashes and boils in her body don't buy this product
Siddharth,"Quality of product has deteriorated badly. The two boxes I purchased got ""burnt grains"". Also some of the seeds float when milk is put, meaning the company is now using expired items. Even the rasins are put like lump of balls...
Only thing that is good is the packing... not the actual product.
Anyway, this company planned that they will initially gain customer confidence, get good rating and later give 3rd class product.
Very disappointing..."
Samrat,Very bad taste and smell.
